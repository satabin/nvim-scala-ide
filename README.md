# An Opinionated Scala IDE based on VIM

To run it locally, you can run the following command:

```shell
$ nix run github:satabin/nvim-scala-ide
```

If you want to use pre-compiled versions (linux amd64 and macos arm64), you can [setup my cachix cache first](https://app.cachix.org/cache/satabin#pull). This way you will avoid compiling everything locally the first time.
